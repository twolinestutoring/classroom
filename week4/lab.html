    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    
    <h3>Step 1:</h3>
    <P>Choose 3-5 of the Computer Engeneering FQA's to include in your project and create the HTML for your project.</P>
    <p>Remember the HTML structure includes a list of questions and answers. Initially, all answer sections are hidden (set to display: none in the CSS). You can use the following code as a refrence. You will need to make changes to include your Questions and the coresponding answer.</p>
    <div class="box">
        <pre><code>
            
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Accordion FAQ&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;styles.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Question 1&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Answer to Question 1 goes here.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;div class=&quot;question&quot;&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Question 2&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;answer&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Answer to Question 2 goes here.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        
        &lt;!-- Add more questions and answers as needed --&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

        </code></pre>
    </div>


    <h3>Step 2: Make you CSS</h3>
    <p>you can change the look of your accordian using the CSS. Use the folowing code is a guide, but make changes to the colors. You can also add borders or box shadow to experiment more with CSS.</p>
    <p>CSS is used to style the questions as clickable buttons. When a question is clicked, it becomes "active" and is highlighted. You can customize the styling to match your design preferences.</p>
    <div class="box">
        <pre><code>
/* Hide all answer sections by default */
.answer {
    display: none;
}

/* Style for questions to make them look like clickable buttons */
.question {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    padding: 10px;
    cursor: pointer;
}

/* Style for active questions */
.question.active {
    background-color: #ccc;
}
        </code></pre>
    </div>

    <h3>Step 3: Add JavaScript</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is used to add interactivity. It listens for click events on the questions. When a question is clicked, it toggles the 'active' class to change the styling, and it toggles the display of the associated answer section. This creates the accordion effect.</p>
    <p>each of the folowing lines introduces new variables and js elements. Make sure to watch this weeks video to better understand js.</p>
    <div class="box">
        <pre><code>
const questions = document.querySelectorAll('.question');

questions.forEach((question) =&gt; {
    question.addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {
        // Toggle the 'active' class for the clicked question
        question.classList.toggle('active');

        // Get the associated answer element
        const answer = question.nextElementElement;

        // Toggle the display of the answer
        if (question.classList.contains('active')) {
            answer.style.display = 'block';
        } else {
            answer.style.display = 'none';
        }
    });
});
        </code></pre>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Step 4: Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Answer the following questions about JS.</p>
    <ul> 
        <li>What does "const" mean in our js code?</li>
        <li>what does a basic function look like in js?</li>
        <li>How do if, else statments work?</li>
    </ul>
