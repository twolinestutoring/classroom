    **Activity Title:** Link and Button Styling with CSS

    **Objective:** Teach students how to create and style links and buttons using HTML and CSS.
    
    **Materials:**
    - A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++)
    - Web browser (for testing)
    - Internet connection (optional, for online resources)
    
    **Instructions:**
    
    **Step 1: Setup**
    Before starting the activity, make sure everyone has access to a code editor and a web browser. Ensure that students understand the basics of HTML and CSS.
    
    **Step 2: HTML Structure**
    Begin by creating an HTML file. Instruct students to create a basic HTML structure:
    
   
        <style>
            /* Optional CSS styling for the code box */
            pre {
                background-color: #f5f5f5;
                border: 1px solid #ccc;
                padding: 10px;
                overflow: auto;
            }
            code {
                font-family: "Courier New", monospace;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Example Coding Box</h1>
        <pre><code>
    // This is a sample code snippet
    function greet(name) {
        console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
    }
    greet("John");
            </code></pre>
    </body>
    </html>
    


    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
        <title>Link and Button Styling</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Content will go here -->
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
    
    **Step 3: Creating Links**
    Explain the concept of hyperlinks and how to create links in HTML using the `<a>` (anchor) element. Instruct students to create a navigation menu with three links to different web pages (you can use placeholders like `#` for the URLs):
    
    ```html
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    ```
    
    **Step 4: Basic Button Styling**
    Teach students how to create a basic button using an HTML `<button>` element. Then, introduce them to basic CSS for styling. In your CSS file (styles.css), include the following code:
    
    ```css
    /* Basic button styling */
    button {
        padding: 10px 20px;
        background-color: #3498db;
        color: #fff;
        border: none;
        cursor: pointer;
    }
    ```
    
    In the HTML file, create a button:
    
    ```html
    <button>Click Me</button>
    ```
    
    **Step 5: Hover Effect**
    Introduce students to the concept of hover effects. Modify the CSS to include a hover effect for both links and buttons:
    
    ```css
    /* Hover effect for links */
    a:hover {
        color: #e74c3c;
        text-decoration: underline;
    }
    
    /* Hover effect for buttons */
    button:hover {
        background-color: #e74c3c;
    }
    ```
    
    **Step 6: Additional Styling**
    Encourage students to explore more styling options. They can modify fonts, add borders, change text alignment, etc., to further enhance the appearance of links and buttons.
    
    **Step 7: Testing**
    Instruct students to open their HTML file in a web browser to see the results. They can click on the links and interact with the buttons to ensure everything is working as expected.
    
    **Step 8: Challenges (Optional)**
    For more advanced students or as an extension to the activity, you can provide challenges like:
    
    - Create a dropdown menu in the navigation.
    - Style the links to look like buttons.
    - Add transition effects to the hover states.
    - Create a responsive design for mobile devices.
    
    **Step 9: Share and Discuss**
    Ask students to share their work with the class and discuss the different styles and effects they applied. Encourage questions and troubleshooting if anyone encounters issues.
    
    This activity will help students gain hands-on experience with HTML and CSS while focusing on links and buttons, which are fundamental elements of web development.
